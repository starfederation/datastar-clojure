(ns starfederation.datastar.clojure.adapter.common
  "
  Namespace containing the shared code for each adapter.

  It contains helpers for working with [[OutputStreams]] and assembling SSE
  sending function using several strategies and managing exceptions in the
  adapters.

  The main concept here is what we call \"write profiles\". A write profile is
  a map of 3 keys:
  - [[wrap-output-stream]]
  - [[write!]]
  - [[content-encoding]]

  With these 3 keys we can control buffering aspects of our SSE connection and
  compression functionality.

  Here is an example profile which uses gzip and temporary buffers to
  concatenate SSE event text:

  ```clojure
  (def gzip-profile
    {wrap-output-stream (fn [^OutputStream os] (-> os ->gzip-os ->os-writer))
     content-encoding gzip-content-encoding
     write! (->write-with-temp-buffer!)})
  ```

  The `wrap-output-stream` function will use a [[GZIPOutputStream]] and an
  [[OutputStreamWriter]] constructed with the [[->gzip-os]] and [[->os-writer]]
  helpers.

  To go with this we use a `write!` function constructed with
  [[->write-with-temp-buffer!]].

  If we wanted specific buffer sizes we could do:

  ```clojure
  (def gzip-profile
    {wrap-output-stream (fn[^OutputStream os]
                          (-> os
                              (->gzip-os 1024)
                              ->os-writer))
     content-encoding gzip-content-encoding
     write! (->write-with-temp-buffer! 4096)})
  ```

  The output stream wrapping helpers are:
  - [[->gzip-os]]
  - [[->os-writer]]
  - [[->buffered-writer]]

  The write function helper to go with them are:
  - [[->write-with-temp-buffer!]]
  - [[write-to-buffered-writer!]]

  See the rest of the docstrings for more details.

  - [[starfederation.datastar.clojure.api/close-sse!]] is called explicitely
  - the sse-gen detects that the connection is closed by the client. This
    detection depends on the ring adapter being used. Http-kit AsyncChannel
    detects a broken connection by itself and calls on-close. With the ring
    generic adapter, the default behavior is to close the connection when a
    [[java.io.IOException]] is thrown sending an event.

  When this callback is called it is already not possible to send events
  anymore. It is called synchronously in the same thread that initiates the
  closing process.

  Args:
  - `sse-gen`: the closed SSE generator
  - Depending on the adapter used other arguments may be passed, see doc for
    the adapter you are using.

  Return value:
  The return value isn't used.

  Exception behavior:
  While closing the `sse-gen` several exceptions may be caught:
  - one while closing the underlying output stream
  - one executing this callback

  These exceptions are rethrown wrapped in an `ex-info`. To get at these see
  [[get-closing-exceptions]]."

  - `ctx`: context information about the exception, a map whose keys are:

    - `:event-type`: type of the event that failed
